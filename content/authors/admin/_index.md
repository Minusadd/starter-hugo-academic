Hi, I'm Haotian! I'm a PhD student at Brown University, advised by Prof. [George Konidaris](https://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/). I also work closely with Prof. [Michael Littman](https://www.littmania.com/). My current research interests are centered on helping an intelligent agent learn highly **flexible** skills, while continuing to adapt efficiently to new tasks. I received my bachelor degree from Tianjin University, advised by Prof. [Jianye Hao](http://www.icdai.org/jianye.html). I was a visiting student at UC Berkeley in 2018. I did research internship at [Fuxi AI Lab, Netease.](http://www.neteasegames.com/), and [Noah's Ark Lab, Huawei](http://dev3.noahlab.com.hk/). 

I﻿'m currently doing an internship at [Microsoft Research, Montreal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-montreal/), advised by [Nicolas Le Roux](https://nicolas.le-roux.name/).
