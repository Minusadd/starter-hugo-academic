Hi, I'm Haotian! I'm a PhD student at Brown University, advised by Prof. [George Konidaris](https://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/). My current research interests are centered on helping an intelligent agent learn multiple levels of highly **flexible** skills, while continue adapting to new tasks efficiently. I was a Computer Science Master's student at Brown, advised by Prof. [Michael Littman](https://www.littmania.com/). Previously, I received by bachelor degree from Tianjin University, advised by Prof. [Jianye Hao](http://www.icdai.org/jianye.html). I was a visiting student at UC Berkeley in 2018. I did research internships at [Fuxi AI Lab, Netease.](http://www.neteasegames.com/), and [Noah's Ark Lab, Huawei](http://dev3.noahlab.com.hk/).
