Hi, I'm Haotian! I'm a Computer Science PhD student at Brown University, advised by Prof. [George Konidaris](https://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/). I also work closely with Prof. [Michael Littman](https://www.littmania.com/). Currently I am a research intern at [Google Deepmind](https://deepmind.google/).I received my bachelor degree from Tianjin University, advised by Prof. [Jianye Hao](http://www.icdai.org/jianye.html). I was a visiting student at UC Berkeley in 2018. I﻿ have also spent time as a research intern at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-montreal/), as well as [RAI Institute](https://rai-inst.com/) (Former [Boston Dynamics AI Institute](https://theaiinstitute.com/)). **I am actively seeking full-time research positions. Feel free to reach out!**
