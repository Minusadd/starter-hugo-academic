Hi, I'm Haotian! I'm a PhD student at Brown University. I'm advised by Prof. George Konidaris. My current research interests are centered on helping an intelligent agent learn multiple levels of highly **flexible** skills, while continue adapting to new tasks efficiently. I was a Computer Science Master's student at Brown, advised by Prof. Michael Littman. Previously, I received by bachelor degree from Tianjin University, advised by Prof. Jianye Hao. I was a visiting student at UC Berkeley in 2018. I did research internships at Fuxi AI Lab, Netease. , and Noah's Ark Lab, Huawei.
